# border-harmonization-toolkit
This toolkit serves the harmonization of economic/social data published for a set of districts with changing borders. The data for shifting districts in Interwar Poland are used as an example.

Data documenting all administrative changes is read from a JSON and a versioned model of administrative divisions is constructed as the basis for data harmonization.
