    "### Economic Geography of Interwar Poland\n",
    "This notebook uses the administrative database and files with economic data to compute the GDP of Interwar Poland on the district level and present an overview of the Polish economic geography in the Interwar Period.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a showcase of the use of the whole toolkit. An instance of the AdministrativeHistory class constructed with inputs describing administrative history is used as an API that allows to access, impute, and harmonize data in the database. In the mature form of the toolkit, a PostgreSQL database with economic data will be created and hosted online and a pip-installable package called interwar_poland_database will be publicly shared. The pip package will reconstruct the administrative base locally, and will connect as a read-only-user to the PostgreSQL database to import the necessary data. In this preliminary version of the toolkit, the economic data is stored in the CSV form."
